# Shopware Playwright Suite

Reusable **Playwright + TypeScript** E2E skeleton for **Shopware 6.7 storefronts**.
Built and verified against the solution25 demo shop; designed to be copied into every
new client project and adapted through **one project profile file** instead of code changes.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
cp .env.example .env          # fill in admin API credentials (see below)
npm run test:smoke            # ~45 critical tests, chromium
npm test                      # full suite: chromium + mobile (Pixel 7)
npm run report                # open HTML report
```

Useful variants:

```bash
npx playwright test tests/storefront/cart.spec.ts --headed
npx playwright test --grep @mobile --project=mobile
EXTRA_BROWSERS=firefox,webkit npm test
ALLOW_WRITE_TESTS=false npm test   # production-safe: no customers, orders or form submissions
npm run test:ui                    # Playwright UI mode for debugging
```

### Design principles

| Principle | How |
|---|---|
| **No hardcoded shop data** | URLs, products, categories, search terms, routes, redirects, feature flags → `projects/<name>.ts`. Secrets → `.env` / CI variables. |
| **Language independent** | Selectors use Shopware core classes, ids and form field names — never visible texts. Assertions use body classes (`is-ctl-checkout`) and URLs. |
| **Theme overrides without forking** | `selectors` in the profile is deep-merged over `shopware67Selectors`. Override only the keys a theme changes. |
| **Feature flags** | Tests for disabled features skip automatically (`features.wishlist = false` → wishlist specs skip). |
| **Fast, isolated test data** | Customers are created via Store API, carts filled via the storefront endpoint (same session), cleanup via Admin API. Every test gets its own customer — tests run fully parallel. |
| **Graceful degradation** | No Admin/Store API credentials? Customer registration and cart setup fall back to UI flows. |
| **Production-safe mode** | `ALLOW_WRITE_TESTS=false` skips everything that creates data (orders, customers, contact form). |
| **Page Objects expose intent, specs assert** | `cart.setQuantity(name, 2)` in POM; `expect(...)` stays in the spec. |

### Fixtures

```ts
import { test, expect } from '../../src/fixtures';

test('customer orders', async ({ loggedInPage, cartHelper, checkout, account, cfg }) => {
  await cartHelper.add(cfg.testData.simpleProduct, 2); // API speed, UI session
  await checkout.openConfirm();
  await checkout.placeOrder();
  await account.openOrders();
  await expect(account.orders.first()).toBeVisible();
});
```

| Fixture | Scope | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `cfg` | worker | resolved project config (profile + env + selectors) |
| `adminApi` / `storeApi` | worker | API clients, `null` if no credentials |
| `header`, `navigation`, `listing`, `product`, `cart`, `offcanvasCart`, `auth`, `account`, `checkout`, `contact`, `cookieBanner` | test | page objects |
| `cartHelper` | test | put products into the storefront cart without UI clicks |
| `customer` | test | freshly registered customer (auto-deleted afterwards) |
| `loggedInPage` | test | `page` logged in as `customer` |
| `acceptCookies` | option | `test.use({ acceptCookies: false })` to see the cookie banner |
| `requireWriteAccess` | test | skip test when `ALLOW_WRITE_TESTS=false` |

### Tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `@smoke` | critical path, run on every MR/PR (`npm run test:smoke`) |
| `@mobile` | also runs in the `mobile` project (Pixel 7) |
| `@mobile-only` | runs only in the `mobile` project |
| `@client` | client-specific tests |

---

## Coverage (tests/storefront)

| Spec | Covers |
|---|---|
| `homepage` | header/nav/content/footer, SEO basics, logo link, JS errors, images |
| `cookie-consent` | banner shown, "only necessary", remembered |
| `navigation` | configured categories, every category opens, flyout, breadcrumb |
| `listing` | product boxes, PDP link, pagination, sorting (price/name), filters (manufacturer, property, price, reset) |
| `product-detail` | core info, canonical/structured data, variant switch, breadcrumb, reviews, 404 product |
| `search` | header search, relevance, suggest, no result, XSS-safe input |
| `cart` | add from PDP/listing, quantity (off-canvas + cart page), remove, persistence, promotion codes |
| `checkout` | empty cart guard, login/register gate, guest order, customer order → account, TOS required, payment/shipping methods |
| `registration` | register, empty-form validation, invalid email, short password, duplicate email |
| `login` | login/logout, wrong password, unknown user, header menu, cart kept after login |
| `account` | overview, profile update, addresses, orders, login protection |
| `wishlist` | guest add, wishlist page + remove, persistence (feature-flagged) |
| `forms` | contact form validation + submit, newsletter (feature-flagged) |
| `mobile` | off-canvas nav, burger visibility, no horizontal overflow, off-canvas filters |
| `links-and-errors` | important links, configured redirects, broken header/footer links, sitemap/robots, 404 page, bad params, bad POST |

## Credentials & test data setup

The suite works without API credentials, but is faster and cleans up after itself with them.

1. **Admin API** — recommended: create an *Integration* in the admin
   (*Settings → System → Integrations*, with admin rights) → `ADMIN_CLIENT_ID` / `ADMIN_CLIENT_SECRET`.
   Alternative: `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` of a dedicated test admin user.
2. **Store API access key** — resolved automatically via the Admin API from `BASE_URL`,
   or set `SW_ACCESS_KEY` (*Sales Channels → Storefront → API access*).

Test customers use `<prefix>.<timestamp>.<rand>@<domain>` (default `e2e.…@example.com`).
They are deleted after each test and a teardown project deletes any leftovers by prefix.

---

## Onboarding a new client project (≈ 1–2 hours)

1. **Copy the suite** into the client repo (e.g. `tests/e2e/`) or a separate repo.
2. `cp projects/_template.ts projects/<client>.ts` and fill in every `TODO`:
   - `baseURL`, `locale`
   - `features` — check the client's settings (wishlist, guest checkout, double opt-in, …)
   - `testData` — 1 simple product, 1 variant product, a listing category, main categories, search term
   - `paymentMethod` — an *offline* method (Vorkasse / Rechnung) so orders finish without a PSP redirect
   - `redirects` / `importantLinks` — client SEO redirects and legal pages
3. `.env`: `PROJECT=<client>`, `BASE_URL`, API credentials, basic auth for staging.
4. Run `npm run test:smoke -- --headed`. For every failure decide:
   - **Different markup** → override the selector key in `projects/<client>.ts → selectors`.
   - **Feature not used** → switch the feature flag off.
   - **Different data** → fix `testData`.
   - **Actual bug** → report it
5. Run the full suite, then add client-only tests under `tests/client/` using `src/client/fixtures.ts`.
6. Configure CI (below) with the variables from `.env.example`.

> Rule: **don't edit `tests/storefront/**` in client projects.** If a core test needs a code change
> for one client, make it configurable in the template instead and back-port it here — that is how
> the skeleton gets better with every project.

## CI

- **GitLab**: `.gitlab-ci.yml` — `smoke` on MRs/default branch, sharded `regression` nightly (schedule) or manually.
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` — smoke on PRs, full sharded run on push/nightly.
- **Bitbucket Pipelines**: `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` — smoke on PRs and `main`; `custom: full-regression` (2 parallel shards) for manual runs and nightly schedules (*Pipelines → Schedules*). Secrets go in *Repository settings → Repository variables* (Secured).

Delete the CI files you don't use.

Both use the official `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright` image (keep its version in sync with
`@playwright/test`) and publish the HTML report, traces/videos of failures and a JUnit report.

## Demo shop notes (verified 2026‑09‑24, Shopware 6.7)

- Storefront language is German; tests do not depend on texts.
- Wishlist is **disabled** in the demo sales channel → wishlist tests skip (`features.wishlist`).
- Country list contains only Germany. Registration has no birthday / password confirmation.
- 6.7 renders category flyouts as Bootstrap dropdowns: clicking a root category opens the flyout;
  `MainNavigation.openCategory()` handles both behaviours.
